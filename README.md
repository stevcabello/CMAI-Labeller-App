# CMAI-Labeller-App

Data labeller app created for the [Music Attuned Technology â€“ Care via eHealth (MATCH)](https://www.musicattunedcare.com/) project to facilitate the labelling of agitation symptoms in patients living with dementia.

The agitation symptoms are based on the [Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI)](https://dementiaresearch.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/CMAI_Scale.pdf)
